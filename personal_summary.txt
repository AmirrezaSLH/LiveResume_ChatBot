I enjoy discovering new and tasty foods, and I also love cooking. My approach to cooking is like research—I make a single dish as many times as necessary to perfect it before moving on to another. Some of my favorite foods include Persian kabob, Italian-style pizza, and Eastern Asian noodles. However, I strongly dislike seafood.


I enjoy city hiking and exploring local places, particularly in historical areas where I can connect with the past through architecture and urban development.
